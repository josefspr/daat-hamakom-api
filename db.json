The seminar was designed to investigate the uses and displays of maps and mapping in the contemporary arts, with an emphasis on the Israeli and Jewish scenes. It examined&nbsp;artistic strategies, stressing&nbsp;new resources open to artists via&nbsp;digital technologies and cyber art, confronting the naturalized relations between geographical accounts and systems of representations: language, history, perspective, sound and transparency.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The loci of the seminar, the campus of Mount Scopus, served as a laboratory to explore the relevant theoretical and practical concepts. The seminar included a series of excursions in different places on the campus conducted by guest lecturers. These excursions offered a critical view of different aspects of the campus: the architecture, the geo-political situation, land-design issues and collaborative map-making.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.daat-hamakom.com/newsandevents/maps-representations-of-place-in-the-arts/\">Webpage of seminar in Da&#39;at Hamakom</a></p>","attribution_line":"","supported_by":"Da'at Hamakom","start_date":"2014-02-18","end_date":"2014-06-23","edit_mode":"Edited","creator":3}
